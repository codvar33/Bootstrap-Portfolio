# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Assignment 2 part 1

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last week with a mobile-responsive layout.

This is a basic webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4.
